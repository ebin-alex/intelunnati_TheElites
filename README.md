# Intel FPGA Division Algorithms

This repository contains the project developed during the Intel Unnati internship by the team "The Elites" at Intel's FPGA Division. The objective of the internship was to work on slow and fast division algorithms in computer architecture, specifically targeting the Intel FPGA Cyclone V.

## Algorithms

The team focused on implementing two division algorithms:

1. Restoring Division Algorithm: This algorithm is a classical division method that uses a restoring mechanism to compute the quotient and remainder of a division operation.

2. Newton-Raphson Division Algorithm: This algorithm is an iterative method based on Newton's method for finding roots. It provides a more efficient approach for division by using an initial guess and refining it through iterations.

## Development Environment

The code was developed using the Intel Quartus Prime Lite platform. The implementation is written in Verilog, a hardware description language widely used in FPGA design.

## Team Members

The project was carried out by the following team members:

- Ebin Alex
- Dalaali Shaheen
- Esswari S.

## Mentor

We would like to express our gratitude to our mentors for providing guidance and support throughout the internship:

- Dr. P. Getzi Jeba (Academic Mentor) - getzi@karunya.edu
- Abhishek Nandy (Industry Mentor) - abhisheknandy@theprograms.in

Please feel free to explore the repository and refer to the project documentation for more details on the implementation and usage of the division algorithms. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue or contact any of the team members.

Happy coding!
